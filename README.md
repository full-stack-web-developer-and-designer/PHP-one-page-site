# PHP-one page site
This repository contains a simple single-serving web site that randomly changes one of two text that is please visit mirnes.glamocic.com and visit my page. Then, in the same time is changed the background color of the page, font style, font size, font color, and text-align. All this was done with the help of the PHP function rand. There is implemented a built-in PHP function count that counts the elements of the array, so regardless of the number of elements in the array, they will always be displayed randomly every time the web page is opened or refreshed. With array_delete function color matching for text and background is prevented.

Of course, this project can be used to modify anything else using the rand function.
